To get the closest to pi, the more random numbers the better.  Adding darts didnâ€™t increase runtime by much while increasing the number of games did by a lot.  For this reason, I usually added darts instead of games to consistently hit pi.  It is possible to get pi with much lower numbers, but the best results came around 65,536 with 10 games played.  I saw it hit 3.1416 one time with those settings.  The standard deviation hovered around .008 most of the time.  Adding games and darts will continue to increase accuracy.
